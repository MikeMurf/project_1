**Completed Analysis Uploaded to GitHub:

**Excellent work on the detailed README file which was included in the repo.
Try and explain the structure of your repo as well within the README file - this will make it easier to link the individual .ipynb notebooks to the questions that you have included within your analysis.
Visualisations:

**Quantity of visualisation was good but the quality of certain visuals could be improved for better readability - eg. bar charts could be ordered to better distinguish values that are quite similar
Please try to keep human friendly variable names within visual labels and annotations so no underscores etc.
Analysis and Conclusion:

**Well done on the analysis for each of the question and supporting your findings with the statistical analysis and visualisations
The structure of .ipynb notebooks could be improved by using markdown cells explaining the methodology and some details around the steps that are being followed.
Some of the cells within the .ipynb still had errors
Group Presentation:

**Excellent overview but the storyline could be improved to make the overall presentation even better
The presentation exceeded the time limit by ~4.5 mins
Slide Deck:

**The quality of the slides could be improved by providing more details on the specific issues encountered while cleaning the data for your datasets
Please try and add some context to the slides containing the visualisations **
