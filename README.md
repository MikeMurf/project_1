	Based on the bar chart that visualises the “Total Number of Fully 
Vaccinated People by Country”:
	The two countries with highest fully vaccinated numbers are US and Brazil
	The lowest numbers are New Zealand, Israel, South Africa, and Australia
	Simply based on this visualisation, we could be inclined to conclude that Brazil and the US are the most vaccinated countries in the world with the lowest numbers of fully vaccinated people being from New Zealand, Israel, South Africa, as well as Australia.
