2.	Project Description:
The project uses John Hopkins University Covid-19 datasets and related datasets to determine the statistical significance of the relationship between being vaccinated or unvaccinated and the mortality rate from Covid_19.

3.	Research Questions:
•	What is the relationship between “unvaccinated” Covid patients versus “vaccinated” Covid patients for the following categories in selected countries?
o	Covid vaccination rates per country
o	Total Covid cases
o	Total Covid hospitalisations
o	Total Covid deaths
o	Mortality rates - per 100,000 population
o	Mortality rates – case / fatality ratio
•	What countries / areas will be most impacted?	 
•	What countries / areas will be least impacted?
•	The selected countries are Australia, New Zealand, USA, UK, Italy, Israel, Brazil, South Africa, Vietnam. 

4.	Hypothesis:
•	The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that there is a significant correlation between vaccination status (vaccinated or unvaccinated) and death for Covid patients.
•	The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is not a significant correlation between vaccination status (vaccinated or unvaccinated) and death for Covid patients.


5.	Methodology:

•	The project commenced with a one-off download of a dataset covering some 32 days of data from the John Hopkins University Covid datasets identified above.
•	It then evolved to dynamically downloading the John Hopkins University Covid Time Series datasets using URLS calls and Wget so that it picks up the most recent data when run.
•	It also sourced mortality and vaccination datasets from the sources identified in the “Project datasets” section.
•	Further analysis needs to be done to fully complete the assessments we set out to do. 


5.	Visualisations / Analysis:
The visualisations used are:
•	Pie charts vaccinated vs unvaccinated per country					
•	Bar chart vaccination rates per country						
•	Bar chart total Covid cases per country						
•	Bar chart total Covid hospitalisations per country (if possible)				
•	Bar chart total Covid deaths per country						
•	Bar chart total mortality rates - per 100,000 population per country				
•	Bar chart total mortality rates - case / fatality ratio per country							

6.	Research Questions: Answers / Findings / Conclusions

•	What is the relationship between “unvaccinated” Covid patients versus “vaccinated” Covid patients for the following categories in selected countries?

o	Covid vaccination rates per country
	Covid vaccination rates vary widely with higher vaccination rates in developed countries and lower vaccination rates in less developed countries.

	Based on the bar chart that visualises the “Total Number of Fully 
Vaccinated People by Country”:
	The two countries with highest fully vaccinated numbers are US and Brazil
	The lowest numbers are New Zealand, Israel, South Africa, and Australia
	Simply based on this visualisation, we could be inclined to conclude that Brazil and the US are the most vaccinated countries in the world with the lowest numbers of fully vaccinated people being from New Zealand, Israel, South Africa, as well as Australia.
